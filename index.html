                        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is my first major undertaking as a project.The motivation for this device was my interest in music and my new found interest for Embedded Systems ,
                            I wanted to design something I can add to my life and would be cool to show off to friends(obviously).
                            So , I ordered in some LEDs , an Arduino Mega 2560 and fired up the Arduino IDE.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started with the infamous Blink sketch and then started incrementing it to show different fades and patterns,
                            I like the idea of being able to change the color of your room , looking for how I can do that , I stumbled upon the Vixen DMX software ,
                            this had the capability of syncing my lights to music , this came out of my first attempt.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="span-3">
                        <p style="text-align:center">
                            <img width="400" src="images/Prototype.gif" alt="" />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wired up 6 LEDS and wrote a sketch for Vixen , this was a pretty resposive system and visualisation could be hand arranged and it also had transitions support.
                            I planned to take this up a notch and ordered RGB50/50 LED Strips and a power supply to pair with it , the circuit was simple with a MOSFET controlling voltages on RGB terminals each.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <h3>Experience:</h3>

                        <p>
                            The project took many iterations along the way and as I discovered the ease of using Arduino , I started experimenting with different forms.
                            Most of my time was spent soldering the circuits together and fixing my bad solders(more than often).<br>At one point I even decided to Light up the entire room by sticking one across the ceiling,

                            Needless to say that didn't end well for my small dainty power supply.
                        </p>

                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="span-3">
                        <p>
                            A few fire hazards later , I pivoted to include some sort of wireless components to control this system.
                            I found an android bluetooth app and some contributed code for this. The system worked flawlessy with a physical switch to switch modes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project opened up a lot of avenues for me , I was really fascinated by the concept of making my own electronics as this was the closest to industrial work you can get in undergraduate first year.
                            I was pretty satisfied by the whole system and learnt a lot along the way , namely Soldering, PCB Layout , Power Requirements , Arduino API , and did I mention there was Soldering!!!
                        </p>

                    <div class="span-4">
                        <p>
                            This is the final iteration of the project , I used simple A4 sheets to make the cylinder diffusers and stick a strip on the edge of the table.
                            I later developed some miniatures using an Arduino Nano and a 5V breakout board.
                            <br>
                            That was my manic first foray into the world of Embedded Systems.
