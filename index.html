                        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was in the second semester of my studies at NYU when I took the famed Real-Time Embedded Systems course.And believe me when I say its real good,
                            I got the oppurtunity to design a very fun project (Air Guitar) , the faculty was impressed and later offered me an oppurtunity to work as a Tutor for a new Summer Program hosted by
                            K12 Center for STEM Education at NYU Tandon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Oh , by the way fun story I actually enquired for a TA position but was offered this role as a preliminary test.
                            The challenge was to teach grade 8-12 kids Internet of Things. For the first year (2019) , we were a team of 4 graduate students.
                            Since this was a new program , we also had to develop the course structure , materials and labs.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="span-3">

                        <p>
                            We got to work and a plan was drawn to divide up the workload. I recommended that we design this course as we expect a quality course to be.
                            With this goal and knowing the kids are not experienced programmers and some didn't have any prior experience at all. We were being mentored by Professor M. Campisi ,I was also assigned additional duty to manage the team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We were given a ESP8266 Starter IOT kit from Adafruit and a shield touchscreen to begin with.
                        </p>

                    </div>


                    <div class="span-3">
                        <h3>Batch 1 2019:</h3>
                        <p>
                           P.S This is a long one.We decided to design a course which encompassed all necessary information required to getting started from being a non programmer to being a novice tinkerer capable of continuing their research from there on.
                           We wanted to take extra care about the above sentiment , a complete non-programmer should be able to understand and pace through the course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So the first batch arrived , after a brilliant introduction to our course and what we aim to achieve by our mentor , we were introduced to the class and it was lecture time.
                            We were all standing on the other side of the table for the first time and the twitchiness could be felt across the hall from our room.
                        <br><br> Short story , the reaction was not exactly what we were expecting from our carefully crafted masterpiece of a lecture.
                        </p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="span-3">
                        <p>
                            That day we had lunch with Professor and he told us his story , why he teaches and why he loves it and everyone immediately fell in love with the sentiment.
                            I cannot speak for the others , but I was deeply inspired that day. Something about the idea of sharing my knowledge with people resonated with me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Okay , one thing I have realised about NYU students is , they have unwavering stubborness , once they take up something , they take it to completion and want to be the best at it.
                            Luckily , our team was also made of these extremely resilient students, we went back to the drawing board and went for a complete overkill analysis and overhaul.

                    <div class="span-4">

                        <p>
                            The next day we were in business. Here are the changes we made:
                        <ul>
                        <li> Lectures should be broken down into the most simplest shortest units possible. Build up from small pieces.
                        <li> Since we are working with Embedded Systems , we will involve daily labs to draw interest
                        <li> The labs will also function as practice for everyday concepts
                        <li> Every explaination should be accompainied by an easy to follow analogy from real world
                        <li> We read the room and extrapolate or shrink explainations accoriding to that.
                        </ul
                        </p>
                        With these mottos set in stone , this was the inception of one of the most in demand and applauded Summer courses hosted by NYU.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The great team we had on our side had their own mix of talents , Monish was a great programmer and a very fun ,interactive person ,
                            Ishita carried algorithms knowledge and Tara was the robotics expert , I was the local in-house embedded systems guy.

                            It was a great learning experience for the 4 of us too. The first week went by and we covered and Intro to Programming in C and Embedded Systems and peripherals during this week. In the background we were still figuring out labs and projects for the upcoming week.
                            The projects we came up with were the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li> An ESP8266 Weather Station
                            <li> A GameDay -  Students will team up and make a game playable on their device
                            <li> Adafruit IO(MQTT) and inter-microcontroller communication
                            <li> We also added a tour of MakerSpace and 3D - Printing to print the cases for the weather station
                        </ul
                        </p>

                            This is my first major undertaking as a project.The motivation for this device was my interest in music and my new found interest for Embedded Systems ,
                            I wanted to design something I can add to my life and would be cool to show off to friends(obviously).
                            So , I ordered in some LEDs , an Arduino Mega 2560 and fired up the Arduino IDE.

                            I started with the infamous Blink sketch and then started incrementing it to show different fades and patterns,
                            I like the idea of being able to change the color of your room , looking for how I can do that , I stumbled upon the Vixen DMX software ,
                            this had the capability of syncing my lights to music , this came out of my first attempt.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wired up 6 LEDS and wrote a sketch for Vixen , this was a pretty resposive system and visualisation could be hand arranged and it also had transitions support.
                            I planned to take this up a notch and ordered RGB50/50 LED Strips and a power supply to pair with it , the circuit was simple with a MOSFET controlling voltages on RGB terminals each.

                            The project took many iterations along the way and as I discovered the ease of using Arduino , I started experimenting with different forms.
                            Most of my time was spent soldering the circuits together and fixing my bad solders(more than often).<br>At one point I even decided to Light up the entire room by sticking one across the ceiling,

                            Needless to say that didn't end well for my small dainty power supply.

                            A few fire hazards later , I pivoted to include some sort of wireless components to control this system.
                            I found an android bluetooth app and some contributed code for this. The system worked flawlessy with a physical switch to switch modes.

                            This project opened up a lot of avenues for me , I was really fascinated by the concept of making my own electronics as this was the closest to industrial work you can get in undergraduate first year.
                            I was pretty satisfied by the whole system and learnt a lot along the way , namely Soldering, PCB Layout , Power Requirements , Arduino API , and did I mention there was Soldering!!!

                            This is the final iteration of the project , I used simple A4 sheets to make the cylinder diffusers and stick a strip on the edge of the table.
                            I later developed some miniatures using an Arduino Nano and a 5V breakout board.

                            That was my manic first foray into the world of Embedded Systems.

                            Me: You know I have done some interesting things , wish there was a way to make it show what I have done.
                            <br>
                            Milind: You know what , let's check out LinkedIn , let's see what people do. Ahh , there you have it , A portfolio website , PERFECT!!
                            <br>
                            Me: Wait What ? A website , no way , I hate making websites , ahhhhhhhhh, so much time to arrange things , arrrgghhh.
                            <br>
                            Milind: What? But it looks cool , doesn't it.
                            <br>
                            Me: Damn right it does , but its so much boring work , no way , no.
                            <br>
                            Milind: YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY AND THEN DECIDE!!
                            <br>
                            Me: Okay , Okay , I am gonna do it , but if I am doing it , I am doing it my way.
                            <br>
                            Milind: Hey hey , sure no problem , whatever you want to do.
                            <br>
                            Me: Let's do this ,find a nice template. Done. Read the document. Done. Text Editor Ready.Check.
                            <br>
                            Milind: How about some music while we do this?
                            <br>
                            Me: Wait , I just got an idea...... Music , muhuhuhuhahahahahah
                            <br>
                            Milind: Now we are getting somewhere. You got this.
                            <br>
                            Me: But its soooooo boooring. Argh
